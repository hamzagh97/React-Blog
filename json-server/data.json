The other day, I overheard my dad (49 M) say that he needed to \"complete tasks\" while working at homeðŸ˜¯ðŸ¤¬ don't worry it gets worse. Then I hear my Mom (42 F) say that the amount of time I spend on my computer is \"suspiscios.\" Ummm ok so (#1) ur too good to say \"sus\" ðŸ¤” and (#2) u dont even play amogus??? ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. Even my moms work friend (28 M or somthing idk) came over yesterday to \"look at her vents\" I'm not even making this up ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ But then the worse partðŸ˜‘ every sunday my granpa (69 M) comes over. He reminisces about his \"Crewmates\" from his Navy days and apparently a few of them died so u cry about it at dinner? Just start a new game FFS ðŸ˜† but he's lying so uhhh we get it bro: u just want attention ðŸ˜¯ðŸ˜…ðŸ¤£\n\nThe problem is NONE of them even Play Omungus.
